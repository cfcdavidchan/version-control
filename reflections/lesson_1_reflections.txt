1.How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It is useful and essential for coders

2.How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It helps me a lot when I need to debugging or find out some historical reference.

3.What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros: you can make the version logically rather than just save it for a little change.

Cons: you have to remember to save it manually otherwise you will loss the data.
